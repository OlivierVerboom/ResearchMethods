# Differences in linguistic features based on genre, intended audience and time period
# General Information
This project examines how linguistic features in texts from Project Gutenberg differ based on genre, intended audience and time period. I will be doing this by using the datasets from Project Gutenberg. I want to understand how language changes and evolves over time and within different contexts.
# Background Information
**Whitnet et al. (2011)** shows how genres evolve due to social context, emphasizing genre flexibility and recurring needs of society. They show that digital texts are making the lines in the traditional boundaries between genres thinner.

**Biber and Conrad (2009)** looked into sentence structure and stylistic choices. They vary based on social class, it shows that written texts reflect social hierarchies and educational background a lot.
# Research Question and hypotheses
## Research Question
How do the linguistic features of texts from Project Gutenberg vary based on genre, intended audience and time period?
## Hypotheses
Genres like poetry will have higher lexical diversity compared to non-fiction due to the artistic nature of the genres.

Texts intended for children will have simpler vocabulary and sentence structures compared to texts intended for adults or students.
# Method
## Dataset
Text corpus collected from Project Gutenberg, a repository of public-domain books.
## Stratified Sampling:
Ensure representation across genres, intended audiences and time periods. Texts will be cleaned and prepared for analysis (headers/ footers, tokenization, etc.).
## Tools
* Python
* GitHub
* Gutenberg Project
